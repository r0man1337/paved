# Reveal

Tiles are issued from the deck of **99** at random. Once exhausted, the deck is reset, randomised and issued as before.

Tiles are initially hidden. Players reveal the tiles by clicking `👁️‍🗨️`

Once revealed, the tile is 'in hand'.

Burn the tile to destroy it and get issued a new one (**50** point penalty received) by clicking `🔥`
