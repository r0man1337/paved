# Scoring

Points are scored when structures are closed. Certain character bonuses exist (see **`Characters`**), as well as bonuses for growing larger cities and roads.  

## Tiles

Each tile has a points value. Once a structure is closed, a player is rewarded an accumulation of points according to the total tiles within it. See **`Structures`** for further details on how forest tiles are scored.

## Growing Cities & Roads

Cities and roads have an ever increasing multiplier bonus system according to the number of tiles within them. This is outlined in the following curve, where **1TL = 1P x 1B = 1TP** and ** 30T = 30PT x 2B = 60TP** and so on.
