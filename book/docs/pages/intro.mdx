## Description

PAVED pays homage to the classic multiplayer tile laying board game Carcassonne, but onchain and with its own twists.

In this game, players have the choice to play **Puzzle**, **Solo** and **Multiplayer** modes. Whilst puzzle and solo modes are slower, more thoughtful and methodical games, multiplayer mode offers a fast-paced and intense experience.

All modes involve players strategically paving tiles to construct various map features. Players must place characters on their tiles to influence the allegiance of the developing features and secure points, which they accumulate over the course of a game.

Tile sets are comprised of uniquely styled pieces, encompassing over **37** distinct types. This extensive variety results in an expansive range of possibilities, ensuring a genuinely distinctive building experience every time.

### Puzzle Mode

Puzzle mode involves scoring as many points as possible using a finite deck of **37** tiles. A fresh, randomised seed marks the beginning of a new 24hr, automated competition at 00:00 UTC every single day - forever! Compete against your fellow Pavers in a truly competitive shared gaming experience.

### Solo Mode

Solo mode also involves scoring as many points as possible using a finite deck, this time with **72** tiles. In this mode, the deck is randomised for every game and there is no time limit. Players compete for honour and success hinges on high-level strategic thinking.

### Multiplayer Mode

You guessed it... Multiplayer mode also involves scoring as many points as possible. However, this time players do not only construct map features, but have the opportunity to challenge _other_ players features, and must defend their own. Tiles are randomly drawn from a shuffled deck of **99** tiles, and games are time based (predetermined by the gameâ€™s host). Once the deck is exhausted, it is reset and randomised, then play continues. Beyond individual strategy, success hinges on shrewd tactics and decisiveness.
