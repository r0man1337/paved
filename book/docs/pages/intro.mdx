The Realms lie in ruins, the aftermath of a thousand-year war filled with hard-fought battles and uncelebrated heroes. The dwindled Orders have mustered, and all take charge to build and reclaim the fallen Realms for their own.

## Description

PAVED pays homage to the classic multiplayer tile laying board game Carcassonne, but onchain and with its own twists. In this game, Players align themselves with an Order, acquiring map tiles and strategically constructing or challenging various features to accumulate points. Success hinges on shrewd tactics and decisiveness.

Individual games are created by host players, who predetermine their length and trigger the start when they are satisfied with the number of players in the gameâ€™s waiting room. 

Tiles are randomly drawn from a diverse stack of uniquely styled pieces, encompassing over **37** distinct tile types. This extensive variety results in an expansive range of possibilities, ensuring a genuinely distinctive building experience throughout the game.

Every player also possesses a finite set of characters, each influencing the allegiance of the developing features on the map. The outcome of these territorial contests depends on the formation of closed structures, which in turn determines the allocation of points.

The game offers a fast-paced experience with an infinite supply of tiles. Victory is decided at the end of each game, with rewards distributed to the highest scoring player(s).
