# Structures

A game involves building and closing **4** types of structure.

## Cities

**Red areas** indicate cities.

<div align="center">
    <img width="200" src="city-tile.png" alt="city-tile" />
</div>

Cities are closed by paving a coordinated city tile that leaves no further part of the city open to expansion.

<div align="center">
    <img width="200" src="city-complete.png" alt="city-complete" />
</div>

## Roads

**Yellow stripes** indicate roads. **Black points** indicate the end of a road. A road also ends when it enters a city.

<div align="center">
    <img width="200" src="road-tile.png" alt="road-tile" />
</div>

As with cities, paving a coordinated tile closes a road (assuming the road is also closed on both ends).

<div align="center">
    <img width="200" src="road-complete.png" alt="road-complete" />
</div>

## Wonders

**Temple icons** indicate wonders.

<div align="center">
    <img width="200" src="wonder-tile.png" alt="wonder-tile" />
</div>

A wonder is closed by paving all the tiles that immidiately surround it.

<div align="center">
    <img width="200" src="wonder-complete.png" alt="wonder-complete" />
</div>

## Forests

**Green areas** indicate forests.

<div align="center">
    <img width="200" src="forest-tile.png" alt="forest-tile" />
</div>

There are **3** ways to close forests, all of which involve them being completely enclosed.

The first way is to close the forest by enclosing it with **city/cities**.

<div align="center">
    <img width="200" src="forest-complete-city.png" alt="forest-complete-city" />
</div>

:::note
Note: in this example, a **Herdsman** has been placed within the forest, so would score for **5** closed cities.
:::

The second way is by enclosing it with **roads**.

<div align="center">
    <img width="200" src="forest-complete-road.png" alt="forest-complete-road" />
</div>

:::note
Note: in this example, a **Woodsman** has been placed, so would score for **4** closed roads.
:::

The third way is with a combination of **both**.

:::note
NB: Forests **do not** score in **PUZZLE MODE**.
