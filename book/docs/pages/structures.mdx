# Structures

A game involves building and closing these **4** structures as follows.

## Cities

Red areas indicate **cities**.

Cities are closed by paving a coordinated city tile that leaves no further part of the city open to expansion.

## Roads

Yellow stripes indicated **roads**. Black **Points** indicate the end of a road.

As with cities, paving a coordinated tile closes a road (assuming the road also a black point on both ends).

## Wonders

Temple icons indicate **wonders**.

Wonders are closed by paving all the tiles that immidiately surround it.

## Forests

Green areas indicate **forests**.

There are **3** ways to close forests, all of which involve them being completely enclosed.

The first way is to close the forest by enclosing it with **city/cities**.

The second way is by enclosing it with **roads**.

The third way is with a combination of **both**.
