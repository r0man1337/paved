# Structures

A game involves building and closing these **4** structures as follows.

## Cities

Red areas indicate **cities**.

![city tile](city.tile.png)

Cities are closed by paving a coordinated city tile that leaves no further part of the city open to expansion.

## Roads

Yellow stripes indicated **roads**. Black **Points** indicate the end of a road. A road also ends when it enters a city.

As with cities, paving a coordinated tile closes a road (assuming the road is also closed on both ends).

## Wonders

Temple icons indicate **wonders**.

Wonders are closed by paving all the tiles that immidiately surround it.

## Forests

Green areas indicate **forests**.

There are **3** ways to close forests, all of which involve them being completely enclosed.

The first way is to close the forest by enclosing it with **city/cities**.

:::note
Note: in this example, a **Herdsman** has been placed within the forest, so would score for **5** closed cities.
:::

The second way is by enclosing it with **roads**.

:::note
Note: in this example, a **Woodsman** has been placed, so would score for **4** closed roads.
:::

The third way is with a combination of **both**.
