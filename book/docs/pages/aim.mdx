# Aim

The winner of a game of PAVED is the Player who has scored the most points at the end of the game. 

There is no turn taking. Players may lay tiles as rapidly as their fingers allow. 

As tiles are laid, **Cities**, **Roads**, **Wonders** and **Forests** are formed and developed. Placing your **Characters** on these tiles gives you the opportunity to accumulate points, which are scored when structures are closed or completed. When the game is over, the player(s) with the highest score(s) receive their rewards.
